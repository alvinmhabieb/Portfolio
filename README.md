# Data Analytics, Data Science, and Business Intelligence Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my work and projects in the fields of Data Analytics, Data Science, and Business Intelligence. Each project in this portfolio has been carefully designed to demonstrate my expertise in leveraging data to uncover insights, predict trends, and support strategic decision-making.

## Portfolio Overview

Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this portfolio. Each project focuses on a different aspect of data analytics and machine learning, ranging from customer segmentation to predictive modeling and beyond.

- **Bank Customer Exited Prediction**: A predictive model to identify the likelihood of a bank's customers exiting based on historical data.
- **Company Bankruptcy Prediction**: Utilizing machine learning to predict the potential risk of bankruptcy for companies.
- **Credit Card Application Prediction**: A model designed to predict the approval status of credit card applications using applicant data.
- **Customer Segmentation Prediction using XGBoost**: Employing the XGBoost algorithm to segment customers based on their behaviors and characteristics.
- **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Explanatory Model Analysis and Customer Lifetime Values**: Analyzing the Olist e-commerce dataset to understand customer behaviors and calculate customer lifetime value.
- **Students Adaptivity Level in Online Education**: Predicting students' adaptivity levels in online learning environments based on their engagement and performance.
- **Tour & Travels Customer Churn Prediction**: A churn prediction model for the tourism industry to identify customers at risk of discontinuing service.
